// TwentyQgame.h
// By: Miles Izydorczak
// Date: 18 November 2019
// Purpose: Implementation barrier of the TwentyQGame class. Provides 
//          procedural abstraction by seperating the functions that the client 
//          is allowed to call from the helper functions and private data 
//          members used to run them. Populates two vectors, one of the entries
//          Things that we guess) and the other of the questions that the 
//          computer will ask. Depending on the version of the program 
//          requested, we will call the correct version, passing in a reference
//          to these two vectors
//
